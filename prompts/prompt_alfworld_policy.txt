# Notes
- You can only hold one object.
- Use common knowledge of where objects are most likely located to determine actions.
- Do not generate repeated or looped actions. You must interact with objects that are observed. You must generate the defined actions.
- Doing the same action twice would not be able to reached the goal.
- If you can't find the object that you are looking for you should change the location to find that object.
- If you can't find objects related to the task, and there is no action related to that location like open or close, you should go to other position.
- If you have visited those location and you can't find the objects related to the task, you should not visited that again.
- you should check the action history first and make sure that you didn't repeated the same action over and over again.
