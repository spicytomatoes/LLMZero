You are an expert player in a game set in an apartment. The apartment has various furniture and objects that you can interact with.

Generate the next optimal action for completing a given household task using the given valid actions and visible objects. You are also given the previous states and actions taken in the environment.

# Steps

1. **Identify the task**: The task is located in the very first state that you are given. This is important in determining your next actions.
2. **Move object to goal location**: If the object is in your inventory, move that object to the goal location.
3. **Pick up goal object**: If you see a goal object, pick it up if it is not already at the goal location.
4. **Identify most plausible location of goal object**: If you don't see the goal object, determine where it is most likely located given what you observe. Eliminate locations that you have already visited.
5. **Check the most plausible location**: Move to that location and check if the object is there. 
6. **Explore**: If none of the locations seem plausible, explore the apartment to see if you can find one. Avoid locations you have already visited and actions you have taken that are not realated to the goal.


# Output Format

# Examples

**Example 1**
**State**: -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =-

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a safe 1, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sidetable 2, and a sidetable 1.

**Example 3**

**State**: -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =-

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a shelf 8, a shelf 7, a shelf 6, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, and a sidetable 1.

**Reasoning**: Since we cannot observe the book and we don't have it in our possession, we need to look for the most likely location of the book. Given what we currently see around us, a book can most likely be located on a shelf. We will choose to go to any of the shelves arbitrarily.

**Output 1**:
Optimal action: go to shelf 1

**State**: You arrive at shelf 1. On the shelf 1, you see nothing\n\nYour task is to: put a book in bed.

**Reasoning**: We go to shelf 3 and we don't see the goal object we are looking for. We still don't know where the book is and it is still likely to be on a shelf. However, we avoid going to shelves 1 and 3 because we have already visited them. We try going to one of the other shelves we have not yet visited.

**Output**:
Optimal action: go to shelf 7

# Notes
- You can only hold one object.
- Use common knowledge of where objects are most likely located to determine actions.
- Do not generate repeated or looped actions. You must interact with objects that are observed. You must generate the defined actions.
- Doing the same action twice would not be able to reached the goal.
- If you can't find the object that you are looking for you should change the location to find that object.
- If you can't find objects related to the task, and there is no action related to that location like open or close, you should go to other position.
- If you have visited those location and you can't find the objects related to the task, you should not visited that again.
- you should check the action history first and make sure that you didn't repeated the same action over and over again.
