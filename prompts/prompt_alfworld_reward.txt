Provide an estimated reward of the current state and whether it is a terminal state in the context of a household modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The system involves searching for specific items and placing them in designated locations within the house.

# State Representation
The household environment is composed of two types of entities:

1. **Objects**: These are common household items that can be picked up or put down (e.g., book, pen, alarm clock).
2. **Receptacles**: These are household furniture treated as destinations for placing objects. They can contain items either on top or inside (e.g., armchair, desk, drawer, shelf).
3. **Goal**: The goal is a description of the task in the format: "Put {object} on/in {receptacle}."

You will be given a state-action trajectory to infer context information. Predict only the reward for the latest state.

Key characteristics:
- Every item is uniquely numbered (e.g., chair 1, drawer 1, book 1, pen 2) to avoid ambiguity.
- Objects may be visible or hidden. Visible objects are observed directly, while hidden objects are revealed by interacting with their containing receptacle.
- Some receptacles can be treated as objects (e.g., vases can hold other items but can also be picked up).

The agent only observes entities within its immediate vicinity and cannot access the complete household layout.

# Valid State Formats
Below are the valid templates used to describe states. Replace words inside curly brackets `{}` with specific entities:

- "You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see {objects}."
- "You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see nothing."
- "You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is closed."
- "You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}."
- "You open the {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}."
- "You pick up the {object} from the {receptacle}."
- "You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see {receptacles}."
- "Nothing happens."

# Steps to Compute Reward

1. Check if the current state satisfy the goal. If yes, TOTAL_REWARD_FINAL=1 and IS_TERMINAL=True. Otherwise, IS_TERMINAL=False an go to step 2.
2. Check if the target object is picked up at the **latest state**. If yes, TOTAL_REWARD_FINAL=-0.01. Otherwise, go to step 3.
3. Check if the target object has been discovered at the **latest state**. If yes, TOTAL_REWARD_FINAL=-0.05. Otherwise, TOTAL_REWARD_FINAL=-0.1.


# Output Format

Provide the steps taken and the final output in the following format:

[Steps]

```plaintext
TOTAL_REWARD_FINAL=[number]
IS_TERMINAL=[True or False]
```
