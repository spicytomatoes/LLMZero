Provide a sample reward of an elevator system modeled as an MDP (Markov Decision Process) based on current state. The system involves managing passenger pickups and elevator movement inside a building.

# State Representation

In this building, there are 5 floors, numbered 1 to 5. Some characteristics of the building elevator system include:

- Floors 2 to 5 may have up to 3 passengers waiting at any given time.
- The elevator can carry up to 10 passengers.
- The elevator can either move up or down, and the elevator doors can either be open or closed.

The state will be represented in plain text as follows:
**State**:
People waiting at floor 2: (0-3)
People waiting at floor 3: (0-3)
People waiting at floor 4: (0-3)
People waiting at floor 5: (0-3)
Elevator at floor (1-5)
There are (0-10) people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving (up/down).
Elevator door is (open/closed).

# Steps to Calculate Reward at current state

The reward calculation consist of following variables:
  - **floors**: The number of floors this building has
  - **max_in_ele**: The maximum number of people in the elevator
  - **in_ele_penalty**: The constant coefficient of penalty when people is in the elevator
  - **people_waiting_penalty**: The constant coefficient of penalty when people at Floors
  - **reward_delivered**: The reward when one person is delivered to floor 1
  - **people_in_ele**: Number of people in the elevator
  - **total_number_of_people_waiting**: Total number of people waiting outside elevator except floor 1
  - **action**: **nothing**, **move**, **open**, **close**

Reward calculation steps:
1. **Reward for Delivered Passengers**:
  - If the elevator is at floor 1, it means passengers have reached their destination.
  - Calculate the reward from passengers delivered:
    - elevator at floor 1
      REWARD_DELIVERED = reward_delivered * people_in_ele
    - elevator not at floor 1
      REWARD_DELIVERED = 0

2. **Penalty for People in the Elevator**:
  - Each person in the elevator incurs a penalty.
  - Calculate the penalty if passengers in the elevator:
    - if no passangers in elevator
      PENALTY_IN_ELEVATOR = 0.0
    - if at least one passagers in elevator
      PENALTY_IN_ELEVATOR = in_ele_penalty

3. **Penalty for People Waiting on Floors**:
  - Each passenger waiting on any floor (all floors except floor 1) incur a penalty.
  - Sum up the penalties for each floorâ€™s waiting passengers:
    PENALTY_WAITING = people_waiting_penalty * total_number_of_people_waiting 

4. **Total Reward Calculation**:
  - Combine the above terms to compute the total reward:
    TOTAL_REWARD = REWARD_DELIVERED - PENALTY_IN_ELEVATOR - PENALTY_WAITING

# Variables
1. **floors**: 5
2. **in_ele_penalty**: 0.75
3. **people_waiting_penalty**: 3.0
4. **reward_delivered**: 30.0

# Output Format

Provide your reasoning, then compute the reward. The reasoning should be following the steps above and concise. The output state should be represented in the following text format:

```plaintext
**Reasoning**:
1. **Reward for Delivered Passengers**: Elevator [in/not in] floor 1, REWARD_DELIVERED = [number]
2. **Penalty for People in the Elevator**: Passengers [in/not in] elevator, PENALTY_IN_ELEVATOR = in_ele_penalty
3. **Penalty for People Waiting on Floors**:
  - floor 2: [number] people
  - floor 3: [number] people
  - floor 4: [number] people
  - floor 5: [number] people
  PENALTY_WAITING = [people_waiting_penalty] * (floor 2: [number] people + floor 3: [number] people + floor 4: [number] people + floor 5: [number] people) = [number]
4. **Total Reward Calculation**:
  TOTAL_REWARD = REWARD_DELIVERED - (PENALTY_IN_ELEVATOR + PENALTY_WAITING) = [number]
  TOTAL_REWARD_FINAL = [number]
```

#### Output ####
```plaintext
**Reasoning**:
1. **Reward for Delivered Passengers**: Elevator not in floor 1, REWARD_DELIVERED = 0.0
2. **Penalty for People in the Elevator**: Passengers in elevator, PENALTY_IN_ELEVATOR = 0.75
3. **Penalty for People Waiting on Floors**:
  - floor 2: 1 people
  - floor 3: 2 people
  - floor 4: 3 people
  - floor 5: 1 people
  PENALTY_WAITING = 3.0 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 1) = 21.0
4. **Total Reward Calculation**:
  TOTAL_REWARD = 0.0 - (0.75 + 21.0) = -21.75
  TOTAL_REWARD_FINAL = -21.75
