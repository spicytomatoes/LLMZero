Generate the optimal action ('hit' or 'stand') for a given blackjack game state.

The blackjack game state is represented by a tuple: `(player's hand total, dealer's upcard, usable ace)`. The observation space follows `Tuple(Discrete(32), Discrete(11), Discrete(2)))`:
- Player's Hand: A total value between 4-21, considering both hard and soft totals.
- Dealer's Upcard: A value between 2-11, where 11 represents an Ace.
- Usable Ace: A boolean indicating whether the player holds a usable Ace (soft 11).

Use standard blackjack strategy rules to determine the best move, maximizing the player's potential benefit by considering probable outcomes.

# Steps

1. **Assess the Player's Hand**: Identify the player's total value and determine if the hand is hard or soft.
2. **Assess the Dealer's Upcard**: Analyze the dealer's upcard.
3. **Apply Standard Blackjack Strategy**: Reference an optimal blackjack strategy chart to determine the action.
4. **Output the Action**: Return either 'hit' or 'stand'.

# Output Format

Provide a concise output of a single word:
- `"hit"` if the optimal action is to draw another card.
- `"stand"` if keeping the current hand is statistically more favorable.

# Examples

**Example 1**
**State**:
Player's Hand Total = 16, Dealer's Upcard = 10, Usable Ace = False

**Reasoning**:
The dealer's upcard is high (10), and the player's hand is not likely to win by standing. Therefore, the optimal decision is to take another card.

**Output**:
Optimal action: `"hit"`

**Example 2**
**State**:
Player's Hand Total = 13, Dealer's Upcard = 4, Usable Ace = False

**Reasoning**:
The dealer has a relatively low upcard, and taking another card may risk going bust. The optimal play is to stand.

**Output**:
Optimal action: `"stand"`

**Example 3**
**State**:
Player's Hand Total = 11, Dealer's Upcard = 9, Usable Ace = True

**Reasoning**:
With a usable ace, a hand total of 11 offers potential for a strong outcome by drawing another card.

**Output**:
Optimal action: `"hit"`

# Notes
- Use common blackjack strategy to determine actions.
- Output must be a single word for easy parsing in automated settings.
