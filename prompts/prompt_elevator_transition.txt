Provide a sample next state of an elevator system modeled as an MDP (Markov Decision Process) based on a given action. The system involves managing passenger pickups and elevator movement inside a building.

# State Representation

In this building, there are 5 floors, numbered 1 to 5. Some characteristics of the building elevator system include:

- Floors 2 to 5 may have up to 3 passengers waiting at any given time.
- The elevator can carry up to 10 passengers.
- The elevator can either move up or down, and the elevator doors can either be open or closed.

The state will be represented in plain text as follows:
**State**:
People waiting at floor 2: (0-3)
People waiting at floor 3: (0-3)
People waiting at floor 4: (0-3)
People waiting at floor 5: (0-3)
Elevator at floor (1-5)
There are (0-10) people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving (up/down).
Elevator door is (open/closed).

# Valid Actions

The valid actions are:
1. **nothing**: The elevator not move, open, or close its doors.
2. **move**: The elevator attempts to move one floor in the current direction.
3. **open**: The elevator opens its door.
4. **close**: The elevator closes its door.

# Transition Rules

1. **Passenger Boarding Rules**:  
   - If the elevator door is open and passengers are waiting on that floor, they will enter the elevator, subject to capacity.
   - If capacity is reached, any remaining passengers will leave by taking the stairs.

2. **Passenger Exit Rule**:
   - If the elevator is at floor 1, all passengers will exit the elevator regardless if the door is open or not.

3. **Elevator Direction Adjustment**:  
   - The elevator changes direction when at the limits:
     - At floor 1, the direction changes from down to up.
     - At floor 5, the direction changes from up to down.

4. **Random Passenger Arrivals**:  
   - For any of floors 2-5, new passengers may arrive if the floor is not already full. The process is random, and you can freely decide any new passengers arrive.

5. **Elevator Movement**:
   - The elevator can only move while the door is closed.
   - The elevator can only move to a valid floor. The elevator cannot move up on floor 5 or move down on floor 1. The elevator will remain on the same floor if it tries to move to an invalid floor.
   - The elevator will only move if the action is "move".
   - If all 3 conditions are met, the elevator will move 1 floor in the current direction.

6. **Opening/Closing the Door**:
   - If the action is "open", the elevator door will open, and the direction will be changed to down.
   - If the action is "close", the elevator door will close, other features of the state are unaffected.

# Steps to Determine Next State

1. Check if rule 1, the **Passenger Boarding Rules** applies to the current state, then apply the appropriate effects.
2. Repeat step 1 for each of the rules in order.

# Output Format

Provide your reasoning, then predict the next state. The reasoning should be following the steps above and concise. The output state should be represented in the following text format:

```plaintext
Next state:
People waiting at floor 2: [number]
People waiting at floor 3: [number]
People waiting at floor 4: [number]
People waiting at floor 5: [number]
Elevator at floor [number].
There are [number] people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving [direction].
Elevator door is [state].
```

# Examples

### Example 1 
**Current State**:  
People waiting at floor 2: 0  
People waiting at floor 3: 0  
People waiting at floor 4: 1  
People waiting at floor 5: 0  
Elevator at floor 1.  
There are 0 people in the elevator.  
Elevator is moving up.  
Elevator door is closed.  

**Action**: move  

**Reasoning**:
1. **Passenger Boarding Rules**: Does not apply because the elevator door is closed. 
2. **Passenger Exit Rule**: Does not apply because there are no one inside the elevator.
3. **Elevator Direction Adjustment**: The elevator is at floor 1 but is moving up. No changes needed.
4. **Random Passenger Arrivals**: Randomly decided to have no new arrivals.
5. **Elevator Movement**: The elevator is at floor 1 and moving up, the door is closed and the action is "move". All conditions are satisfied and the elevator will move to floor 2.
6. **Opening/closing of the door**: Does not apply because action is neither "open" or "close". 

```plaintext
Next State: 
People waiting at floor 2: 0
People waiting at floor 3: 0
People waiting at floor 4: 1  
People waiting at floor 5: 0
Elevator at floor 2.
There are 0 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving up.
Elevator door is closed.
```

### Example 2
**Current State**:
People waiting at floor 2: 1
People waiting at floor 3: 3
People waiting at floor 4: 0
People waiting at floor 5: 2
Elevator at floor 2.
There are 1 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is closed.

**Action**: nothing

**Reasoning**:
1. **Passenger Boarding Rules**: Does not apply because the elevator door is closed. 
2. **Passenger Exit Rule**: Does not apply because the elevator is not at floor 1.
3. **Elevator Direction Adjustment**: Does not apply because the elevator is neither at floor 1 or floor 5.
4. **Random Passenger Arrivals**: Randomly decided to have 1 new passengers arriving on floor 2. Confirmed the arrival is valid because floor 2 has 2 vacancies remaining.
5. **Elevator Movement**: Does not apply because the action is not "move"
6. **Opening/closing of the door**: Does not apply because action is neither "open" or "close".

```plaintext
Next State: 
People waiting at floor 2: 2
People waiting at floor 3: 3
People waiting at floor 4: 0
People waiting at floor 5: 2
Elevator at floor 2.
There are 1 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is closed.
```

### Example 3
**Current State**:
People waiting at floor 2: 1
People waiting at floor 3: 3
People waiting at floor 4: 3
People waiting at floor 5: 2
Elevator at floor 2.
There are 1 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is open.

**Action**: move

**Reasoning**:
1. **Passenger Boarding Rules**: The door is open. The elevator is at floor 2 and there is 1 passenger waiting. The passengers enter the elevator since there is enough space inside.
2. **Passenger Exit Rule**: Does not apply because the elevator is not at floor 1.
3. **Elevator Direction Adjustment**: Does not apply because the elevator is neither at floor 1 or floor 5.
4. **Random Passenger Arrivals**: Randomly decided to have no new arrivals.
5. **Elevator Movement**: The elevator door is open. Therefore "move" is invalid since it does not satisfy the pre-condition.
6. **Opening/closing of the door**: Does not apply because action is neither "open" or "close".

```plaintext
Next State: 
People waiting at floor 2: 0
People waiting at floor 3: 3
People waiting at floor 4: 3
People waiting at floor 5: 2
Elevator at floor 2.
There are 1 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is open.
```

### Example 4
**Current State**:
People waiting at floor 2: 1
People waiting at floor 3: 3
People waiting at floor 4: 3
People waiting at floor 5: 2
Elevator at floor 4.
There are 0 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is open.

**Action**: close

**Reasoning**:
1. **Passenger Boarding Rules**: The door is open. The elevator is at floor 4 and there are 3 passengers waiting. The passengers enter the elevator since there is enough space inside.
2. **Passenger Exit Rule**: Does not apply because the elevator is not at floor 1.
3. **Elevator Direction Adjustment**: Does not apply because the elevator is neither at floor 1 or floor 5.
4. **Random Passenger Arrivals**: Randomly decided to have no new arrivals.
5. **Elevator Movement**: Does not apply because the action is not "move".
6. **Opening/closing of the door**: Action is "close". The door will be closed on the next state.

```plaintext
Next State: 
People waiting at floor 2: 1
People waiting at floor 3: 3
People waiting at floor 4: 0
People waiting at floor 5: 2
Elevator at floor 4.
There are 3 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is closed.
```

### Example 5
**Current State**:
People waiting at floor 2: 1

People waiting at floor 4: 0
People waiting at floor 5: 3
Elevator at floor 3.
There are 8 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is open.

**Action**: close

**Reasoning**:
1. **Passenger Boarding Rules**: The door is open. The elevator is at floor 3 and there are 3 passengers waiting. 2 of the passengers enter the elevator and 1 left to take the stairs because the elevator is full.
2. **Passenger Exit Rule**: Does not apply because the elevator is not at floor 1.
3. **Elevator Direction Adjustment**: Does not apply because the elevator is neither at floor 1 or floor 5.
4. **Random Passenger Arrivals**: Randomly decided to have no new arrivals.
5. **Elevator Movement**: Does not apply because the action is not "move".
6. **Opening/closing of the door**: Action is "close". The door will be closed on the next state.

```plaintext
Next State: 
People waiting at floor 2: 1
People waiting at floor 3: 0
People waiting at floor 4: 0
People waiting at floor 5: 3
Elevator at floor 3.
There are 10 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is closed.
```

### Example 6
**Current State**:

People waiting at floor 4: 1
People waiting at floor 5: 0
Elevator at floor 1.
There are 4 people in the elevator.
Elevator is moving down.
Elevator door is closed.

**Action**: move

**Reasoning**:
1. **Passenger Boarding Rules**: Does not apply because the elevator is at floor 1.
2. **Passenger Exit Rule**: Elevator is at floor 1. All passengers leaves.
3. **Elevator Direction Adjustment**: The elevator is at floor 1 and moving down. The direction will be changed to "up".
4. **Random Passenger Arrivals**: Randomly decided to have 1 new passenger arriving on floor 3 and 1 new passenger arriving  on floor 4. Confirmed both arrivals are valid because there enough space on all floors.
5. **Elevator Movement**: The elevator is at floor 1 and moving down. The "move" action is invalid and the elevator will remain on floor 1.
6. **Opening/closing of the door**: Does not apply because action is neither "open" or "close".

```plaintext
People waiting at floor 2: 0
People waiting at floor 3: 1
People waiting at floor 4: 2
