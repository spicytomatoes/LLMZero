Provide a sample next state of a household modeled as a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) based on a given action. The system involves looking for specific household items and placing them in specific locations within the house.

# State Representation

The household environment is made up of two types of entities:
1. **Objects**: These are common household items. These objects can be picked up or put down. (ex. book, pen, cd, alarmclock)
2. **Receptacles**: These are household furniture that are treated as locations which agents can visit. They contain objects either on top or inside of them. (ex. armchair, desk, drawer, shelf)

Here are additional characteristics of these entities:
- There may be multiple copies of receptacles or objects. To differentiate them, a number is added to each item regardless of if it has multiple copies or not. (ex. armchair 1, drawer 1, drawer 2, book 1, pen 1, pen 2, pen 3)
- Objects may be visible or hidden in receptacles. Visible objects are observed by the agent upon visiting the location. Hidden objects can only be observed after performing an action on the receptacle.
- There are receptacles that are also treated as objects. They can be picked up or placed down. However, they can also contain items inside of them. (ex. vase)

Agents in the household do not have complete knowledge of the house's layout. Instead, they are only able to observe receptacles and objects within their proximity.

Here are the only valid formats for states. Note you are meant to replace words surrounded by curly brackets ({}) by the specific name of entities.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see {objects}.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see nothing.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is closed.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see nothing.
- You open the {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}.
- You open the {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see nothing.
- You close the {receptacle}.
- You pick up the {object} from the {name}.
- You pick up the {object}.
- You put the {object} in/on the {receptacle}.
- You put the {object} in the {receptacle}.
- You are carrying: {objects}.
- You are not carrying anything.
- Nothing happens.

# Valid Actions

The valid actions are dependent on the current state you are in because they are dependent on the objects and receptacles you see. Here are a few examples of valid actions. Note you are meant to replace words surrounded by curly brackets ({}) by the specific name of entities.
- go to {receptacle}
- open {receptacle}
- close {receptacle}
- take {object} from {receptacle}
- put {object} in/on {receptacle}
- inventory
- examine {receptacle}
- examine {object}
- look

# Transition Rules

Below are the types of action the agent can take as well as possible states you can reach. Note you are meant to replace words surrounded by curly brackets ({}) by the specific name of entities.

1. **Moving to a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to move from his current location to another visible location. The next state should move the agent to the next location and show all of the objects and receptacle the agent can observe in the new location.
Action Format: go to {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see {objects}", "You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see nothing.", "You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is closed.", "You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}.", "You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see nothing."

2. **Opening a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to open a receptacle that can be opened. The next state should metion the opened receptacle and show all of objects inside that receptacle.
Action Format: open {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You open the {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}.", "You open the {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see nothing."

3. **Closing a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to close a previously opened receptacle. The next state should mention the closed receptacle.
Action Format: close {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You close the {receptacle}."

4. **Pick up an Object**
This action is taken by the agent to pick up a visible object in receptacle. The next state should move the object to the agent's possession.
Action Format: take {object} from {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You pick up the {object} from the {name}.", "You pick up the {object}."

5. **Place an Object in/on a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to place an object in/on a receptacle. The next state should move the object from the agent's possession to the receptacle.
Action Format: put {object} in/on {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You pick up the {object} from the {name}.", "You pick up the {object}."

6. **Examine an Object or Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to examine a visible object or receptacle. The next state should provide a description for the said entity.
Action Format: examine {receptacle}, examine {object}
Possible Next States: ""

7. **Checking Inventory**
This action is taken by the agent to check the current objects in their possession. The next state should list out all the objects the agent has. This can be done in any state regardless of what the agent observes.
Action Format: inventory
Possible Next States: "You are carrying: {objects}.", "You are not carrying anything."

Notes:
- If the agent takes any action that doesn't follow the formats specified above, the next state is always "Nothing happens."

# Replacing Receptacles and States

For the valid states under State Representation, you are meant to replace the {receptacle} and {object} markers 

# Steps to Determine Next State

1. Choose which transition rule is applicable given the current state and action. The action should match one of the specified action formats or else, the next state is always, "Nothing happens."
2. Once you have an idea of the format of the possible next states, replace the {object} and {receptacle} placeholders with actual household items. Choose items which have a high likelihood of being found there given the household environment, previous state and given action.

# Output Format

Provide your reasoning, then predict the next state. The reasoning should be following the steps above and concise. The output state should be represented in the text format below. Note that {state} in the test is meant to be replaced by what you think is the next state.

```plaintext
Next state: {state}
```

# Examples

### Example 1 
**Current State**:  
-= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =-\n\nYou are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a laundryhamper 1, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, and a sidetable 1.\n\nYour task is to: put a alarmclock in desk.

**Action**: go to sidetable 1  

**Reasoning**:
The given action follows the action format for **Moving to a Receptacle**. Thus, in the next state, we expect the agent to move to the location sidetable 1. Alarmclocks, credit cards, desklamps, keychains, pen and pencils are objects that can usually be found on a sidetable. Using this information, we produce the next output in the format specified.

```plaintext
Next State: 
You arrive at sidetable 1. On the sidetable 1, you see a alarmclock 3, a alarmclock 2, a alarmclock 1, a creditcard 1, a desklamp 1, a keychain 1, a pen 3, a pen 2, and a pencil 3.
```

### Example 2
**Current State**
You arrive at shelf 1. On the shelf 1, you see a cd 1, and a pen 1.

**Action**: some action

**Reasoning**
When comparing the given action to all specified action formats, it is not similar any of them. Therefore, the next state will always be "Nothing happens."

```plaintext
Next State: 
Nothing happens.
```
