Provide a sample next state as well as a list of valid actions of a household modeled as a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) based on a trajectory of previous states and actions. The system involves looking for specific household items and placing them in specific locations within the house.

# Environment Entities

The household environment is made up of two types of entities:
1. **Objects**: These are common household items. These objects can be picked up or put down. (ex. book, pen, cd, alarmclock)
2. **Receptacles**: These are household furniture that are treated as locations which agents can visit. They contain objects either on top or inside of them. (ex. armchair, desk, drawer, shelf)

Here are additional characteristics of these entities:
- There may be multiple copies of receptacles or objects. To differentiate them, a number is added to each item regardless of if it has multiple copies or not. (ex. armchair 1, drawer 1, drawer 2, book 1, pen 1, pen 2, pen 3)
- Objects may be visible or hidden in receptacles. Visible objects are observed by the agent upon visiting the location. Hidden objects can only be observed after performing an action on the receptacle.
- There are receptacles that are also treated as objects. They can be picked up or placed down. However, they can also contain items inside of them. (ex. vase)
- When generating entities, keep in mind the specific task of the agent. This can be found in the previous state.

# State Representation

Agents in the household do not have complete knowledge of the house's layout. Instead, they are only able to observe receptacles and objects within their proximity.

Here are the only valid formats for states. Note you are meant to replace words surrounded by curly brackets ({}) by the specific name of entities.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see {objects}.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see nothing.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is closed.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}.
- You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see nothing.
- You open the {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}.
- You open the {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see nothing.
- You close the {receptacle}.
- You pick up the {object} from the {name}.
- You pick up the {object}.
- You put the {object} in/on the {receptacle}.
- You put the {object} in the {receptacle}.
- On the {receptacle}, you see {objects}.
- You are carrying: {objects}.
- You are not carrying anything.
- You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see {receptacles}.
- You are facing the {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see {objects}.
- Nothing happens.

# Valid Actions

The valid actions are dependent on the current state you are in because they are dependent on the objects and receptacles you see. Here are a few examples of valid actions. Note you are meant to replace words surrounded by curly brackets ({}) by the specific name of entities.
- go to {receptacle}
- open {receptacle}
- close {receptacle}
- take {object} from {receptacle}
- put {object} in/on {receptacle}
- inventory
- examine {receptacle}
- examine {object}
- look

Notes:
- When generating entities for the valid actions, keep in mind the specific task of the agent. This can be found in the given state.
- Actions that you generate should be dependent on the given state which is the new current state of the agent.

# Transition Rules

Below are the types of action the agent can take as well as possible states you can reach. Note you are meant to replace words surrounded by curly brackets ({}) by the specific name of entities.

1. **Moving to a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to move from his current location to another visible location. The next state should move the agent to the next location and show all of the objects and receptacle the agent can observe in the new location. Have a bias to adding the goal object only if it is likely to be found in that state.
Action Format: go to {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see {objects}", "You arrive at {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see nothing.", "You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is closed.", "You arrive at {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {objects}."
Possible Next Actions: Actions that interact with newly observed receptacles and objects.

2. **Opening a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to open a receptacle that can be opened. The next state should mention the opened receptacle and show only the goal object inside.
Action Format: open {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You open the {receptacle}. The {receptacle} is open. In it, you see {goal object}."
Possible Next Actions: Actions that interact with newly observed receptacles and objects.

3. **Closing a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to close a previously opened receptacle. The next state should mention the closed receptacle.
Action Format: close {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You close the {receptacle}."
Possible Next Actions: Similar actions to previous state but do not include actions interacting with objects inside the closed receptacle.

4. **Pick up an Object**
This action is taken by the agent to pick up a visible object in receptacle. The next state should move the object to the agent's possession.
Action Format: take {object} from {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You pick up the {object} from the {name}.", "You pick up the {object}."
Possible Next Actions: Similar actions to previous state but remove the action of picking up the object and add the action of placing the object.

5. **Place an Object in/on a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to place an object in/on a receptacle. The next state should move the object from the agent's possession to the receptacle.
Action Format: put {object} in/on {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "You pick up the {object} from the {name}.", "You pick up the {object}."
Possible Next Actions: Similar actions to previous state but remove the action of placing the object and add the action of picking up the object.

6. **Examine a Receptacle**
This action is taken by the agent to examine a visible receptacle. The next state would be "Nothing happened." The valid_actions would remain exactly the same as the previous state.
Action Format: examine {receptacle}
Possible Next States: "Nothing happened."
Possible Next Actions: The same actions as the previous state.

7. **Examine an Object**
This action is taken by the agent to examine an object in the agent's possession. The next state should describe the object they are seeing.
Action Format: examine {object}
Possible Next States: ""
Possible Next Actions: The same actions as the previous state.

8. **Checking Inventory**
This action is taken by the agent to check the current objects in their possession. The next state should list out all the objects the agent has. This can be done in any state regardless of what the agent observes.
Action Format: inventory
Possible Next States: "You are carrying: {objects}.", "You are not carrying anything."
Possible Next Actions: The same actions as the previous state.

9. **Examining Current Environment**
This action is taken by the agent to observe his current surroundings. The next state should list out all the receptacle and objects the agent can observe. This can be done in any state regardless of what the agent observes.
Action Format: look
Possible Next States: "You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see {receptacles}.", "You are facing the {receptacle}. On the {receptacle}, you see {objects}."
Possible Next Actions: The same actions as the previous state.

Notes:
- If the agent takes any action that doesn't follow the formats specified above, the next state is always "Nothing happens."
- If the agent does any of the following actions: **Examine a Receptacle**, **Examine an Object**, **Checking Inventory**, **Examining Current Environment**, the the list of valid actions is the same as the previous list

# Replacing Receptacles and States

For the valid states under State Representation, you are meant to replace the {receptacle} and {object} markers 

# Steps to Determine Next State

1. Choose which transition rule is applicable given the current state and action. The action should match one of the specified action formats or else, the next state is always, "Nothing happens."
2. Once you have an idea of the format of the possible next states, replace the {object} and {receptacle} placeholders with actual household items. Choose items which have a high likelihood of being found there given the household environment, previous state and given action.

# Steps to Determine Next Valid Actions

1. Choose which transition rule is applicable given the current state and action. The action should match one of the specified action formats or else, the next valid actions are always the same as the previous actions.
2. Given all the previous actions and states, see which actions can most likely be taken from the next state generated in the previous section.
3. Generate a list of possible actions and output them in the specified format given in # Valid Actions.

Notes:
- Here are the valid actions for receptacles: go to {receptacle}, open {receptacle}, close {receptacle}, examine {receptacle}
- Here are the valid actions for objects: take {object} from {receptacle}, put {object} in/on {receptacle}, examine {object}
- These objects can always be done regardless of the current state, previous valid actions, and action: inventory, look
- Eliminate actions that do not make sense given your previous action. (ex. Picking up an object that you picked up from the previous action)

# Output Format

Provide your reasoning, then predict the next state and a list of the next valid actions. The reasoning should be following the steps above and concise. The output state should be represented in the text format below. Note that {state} in the test is meant to be replaced by what you think is the next state.  The placeholder {valid actions}, should be replaced by a comma-separated list of valid actions. Do not add any additional formatting or special characters aside from what is specified in the format.

```plaintext
Next state: {state}
```

```plaintext
Valid actions: {valid_actions}
```

# Examples

### Example 1 
State: -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =-

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a laundryhamper 1, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, and a sidetable 1.

Your task is to: put a alarmclock in desk.
Valid actions: go to bed 1, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to garbagecan 1, go to laundryhamper 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look
Action: go to sidetable 1


State: You arrive at sidetable 1. On the sidetable 1, you see a alarmclock 3, a alarmclock 2, a alarmclock 1, a creditcard 1, a desklamp 1, a keychain 1, a pen 3, a pen 2, and a pencil 3.
Valid actions: examine sidetable 1, go to bed 1, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to garbagecan 1, go to laundryhamper 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, inventory, look, take alarmclock 1 from sidetable 1, take alarmclock 2 from sidetable 1, take alarmclock 3 from sidetable 1, take creditcard 1 from sidetable 1, take keychain 1 from sidetable 1, take pen 2 from sidetable 1, take pen 3 from sidetable 1, take pencil 3 from sidetable 1, use desklamp 1
Action: take alarmclock 1 from sidetable 1


State: You pick up the alarmclock 1 from the sidetable 1.
Valid actions: examine alarmclock 1, examine sidetable 1, go to bed 1, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to garbagecan 1, go to laundryhamper 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, inventory, look, put alarmclock 1 in/on sidetable 1, use desklamp 1
Action: go to desk 1

**Reasoning**:
The latest action follows the action format for **Moving to a Receptacle**. Thus, in the next state, we expect the agent to move to the location desk 1. Imagine the different objects that desk 1 are most likely to contain. We also know from our previous actions that we have picked-up alarm clock 1. Given all of this, our list of valid actions must include being able to put down alarm clock 1, picking up objects from desk 1 and going to other locations. Using this information, we produce the next output in the format specified.

**Output**:
```plaintext
Next State: You arrive at desk 1. On the desk 1, you see a book 2, a bowl 1, a cd 3, a pencil 2, a pencil 1, and a remotecontrol 1.'
```

```plaintext
Valid actions: examine alarmclock 1, examine desk 1, go to bed 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to garbagecan 1, go to laundryhamper 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look, put alarmclock 1 in/on desk 1
```

### Example 2
State: -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =-

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a laundryhamper 1, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, and a sidetable 1.

Your task is to: put a alarmclock in desk.
Valid actions: go to bed 1, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to garbagecan 1, go to laundryhamper 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look
Action: go to shelf 1

State: You arrive at shelf 1. On the shelf 1, you see a cd 1, and a pen 1.\n\nYour task is to: put some pen on shelf.
Valid Actions: examine shelf 1, go to armchair 1, go to bed 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 10, go to drawer 11, go to drawer 12, go to drawer 13, go to drawer 14, go to drawer 15, go to drawer 16, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to drawer 4, go to drawer 5, go to drawer 6, go to drawer 7, go to drawer 8, go to drawer 9, go to dresser 1, go to dresser 2, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 2, go to sidetable 1, go to sidetable 2, inventory, look, take cd 1 from shelf 1, take pen 1 from shelf 1
Action: some action

**Reasoning**
When comparing the given action to all specified action formats, it is not similar any of them. Therefore, the next state will always be "Nothing happens." The next valid actions will also remain the same because of that.

**Output**:
```plaintext
Next State: Nothing happens.
```

```plaintext
Valid actions: examine shelf 1, go to armchair 1, go to bed 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 10, go to drawer 11, go to drawer 12, go to drawer 13, go to drawer 14, go to drawer 15, go to drawer 16, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to drawer 4, go to drawer 5, go to drawer 6, go to drawer 7, go to drawer 8, go to drawer 9, go to dresser 1, go to dresser 2, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 2, go to sidetable 1, go to sidetable 2, inventory, look, take cd 1 from shelf 1, take pen 1 from shelf 1
```

### Example 3
State: -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =-

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a armchair 3, a armchair 2, a armchair 1, a bed 1, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a desk 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a laundryhamper 1, a safe 1, and a sidetable 1.

Your task is to: put a pen in sidetable.
Valid actions: go to armchair 1, go to armchair 2, go to armchair 3, go to bed 1, go to cabinet 1, go to cabinet 2, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to drawer 4, go to garbagecan 1, go to laundryhamper 1, go to safe 1, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look
Action: go to drawer 4


State: You arrive at drawer 4. The drawer 4 is closed.
Valid actions: examine drawer 4, go to armchair 1, go to armchair 2, go to armchair 3, go to bed 1, go to cabinet 1, go to cabinet 2, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to garbagecan 1, go to laundryhamper 1, go to safe 1, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look, open drawer 4
Action: open drawer 4

**Reasoning**
This action has the same action format as **Opening a Receptacle**. This means the agent opened a receptacle, in this case, drawer 4. Drawer 4 will now be open and the agent can observe the objects located inside of it. We always assume that the goal object (alarmclock) is inside a receptacle after opening it. Using this information we replace the {receptacle} and {objects} placeholders from the state format to produce the predicted next state.  Given that we predict the next state to have the drawer opened, we must have new actions to pick up the goal object inside the drawer. We must also add an action to close the shelf.

**Output**:
```plaintext
Next State: You open the drawer 4. The drawer 4 is open. In it, you see a alarmclock 1.
```

```plaintext
Valid actions: close drawer 4, examine drawer 4, go to armchair 1, go to armchair 2, go to armchair 3, go to bed 1, go to cabinet 1, go to cabinet 2, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to drawer 3, go to garbagecan 1, go to laundryhamper 1, go to safe 1, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look, take alarmclock 1 from drawer 4
```

### Example 4
State: -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =-

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a shelf 8, a shelf 7, a shelf 6, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, and a sidetable 1.

Your task is to: put a book in bed.
Valid actions: go to bed 1, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, go to shelf 3, go to shelf 4, go to shelf 5, go to shelf 6, go to shelf 7, go to shelf 8, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look
Action: go to desk 1


State: You arrive at desk 1. On the desk 1, you see a book 1.
Valid actions: examine desk 1, go to bed 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, go to shelf 3, go to shelf 4, go to shelf 5, go to shelf 6, go to shelf 7, go to shelf 8, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look, take book 1 from desk 1
Action: take book 1 from desk 1


State: You pick up the book 1 from the desk 1.
Valid actions: examine book 1, examine desk 1, go to bed 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, go to shelf 3, go to shelf 4, go to shelf 5, go to shelf 6, go to shelf 7, go to shelf 8, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look, put book 1 in/on desk 1
Action: go to bed 1

State: You arrive at bed 1. On the bed 1, you see a laptop 1, a pillow 2, and a pillow 1.
Valid actions: examine bed 1, examine book 1, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, go to shelf 3, go to shelf 4, go to shelf 5, go to shelf 6, go to shelf 7, go to shelf 8, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look, put book 1 in/on bed 1
Action: put book 1 in/on bed 1

**Reasoning**
This action has the same action format as **Place an Object in/on a Receptacle**. Thus, the agent is trying to place an object in his inventory on to a visible receptacle. Based on the previous actions and states, we know that the agent has book 1 in their possession. Book 1 will now be found on bed 1 because the agent placed it on that receptacle.  Given that the book 1 is now on bed 1, we will no longer be able to put it down. Instead, we will have a new action for taking the book. The rest of the actions should be the same.

**Output**:
```plaintext
Next State: You put the book 1 in/on the bed 1.
```

```plaintext
Valid actions: examine bed 1, go to desk 1, go to drawer 1, go to drawer 2, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 1, go to shelf 2, go to shelf 3, go to shelf 4, go to shelf 5, go to shelf 6, go to shelf 7, go to shelf 8, go to sidetable 1, inventory, look, take book 1 from bed 1, take laptop 1 from bed 1, take pillow 1 from bed 1, take pillow 2 from bed 1
```
