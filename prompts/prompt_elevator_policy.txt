Determine the optimal action for the elevator system in a given state, based on the provided conditions and constraints to efficiently transport passengers.

Consider the following critical factors:
- The elevator's current direction.
- Number of people on each floor waiting to be picked up.
- Number of people currently in the elevator and the elevator capacity.
- Whether the door is open or closed.
- The main goal: efficiently transport as many passengers as possible from floors 2 to 5 to the first floor.

The environment's goal is to move passengers from floors 2 to 5 to the first floor as quickly as possible.

Follow these details to make decisions:

- **Goal**: Maximize the number of passengers transported from floors 2-5 to the first floor.
- **Elevator Rules**:
  - Can only pick up passengers if the door is open.
  - Only moves between floors if the door is closed.
  - Can change direction only when at the top or bottom floor or when picking up passengers while moving up.
  - Picks up additional passengers while moving down if space is available.

# Steps

1. **Check if the elevator door is open**
   - If the door is open, **close** the door regardless if there are passengers because the passenger will board before the door closes.
   - go to the next step if the door is closed.

2. **Check if there are passengers on the current floor**
   - If there are **no passengers** on the current floor:
      - **move** to the next floor.
   - Otherwise, go to the next step.

3. **Check if the elevator is moving down**
   - If the elevator is moving down, **open** the door to let passengers in.
   - Otherwise, go to the next step.

4. **Check if there are passengers waiting on a higher floor**
   - If there **are passengers waiting on a higher floor**, **move** to fetch the passengers on the higher floor first.
   - Otherwise, **open** the door to let the passengers in.


# Output Format

Provide the optimal action in the following format, given the current state of the elevator:

```plaintext
Optimal action: [action]
```

Where the action is one of:
- `nothing`
- `move`
- `open door`
- `close door`

# Examples

**Example 1**  
**State**:  
People waiting at floor 2: 2  
People waiting at floor 3: 0  
People waiting at floor 4: 1  
People waiting at floor 5: 0  
Elevator at floor 2.  
There are 0 people in the elevator.  
Elevator is moving down.  
Elevator door is open.  

**Reasoning**:  
1. **Check if the elevator door is open**: Door is open. Close the door.

**Output**:  
```plaintext
Optimal action: close door
```

**Example 2**  
**State**:  
People waiting at floor 2: 0  
People waiting at floor 3: 3  
People waiting at floor 4: 0  
People waiting at floor 5: 2  
Elevator at floor 5.  
There are 3 people in the elevator.  
Elevator is moving down.  
Elevator door is closed.  

**Reasoning**:  
1. **Check if the elevator door is open**: No. Go to step 2.
2. **Check if there are passengers on the current floor**: Yes. Go to step 3.
3. **Check if the elevator is moving down**: Yes. Open the door.

**Output**:  
```plaintext
Optimal action: open door
```  

**Example 3**  
**State**:  
People waiting at floor 2: 0  
People waiting at floor 3: 3 
People waiting at floor 4: 0  
People waiting at floor 5: 1  
Elevator at floor 3.  
There are 0 people in the elevator.  
Elevator is moving up.  
Elevator door is closed.  

**Reasoning**:  
1. **Check if the elevator door is open**: No. Go to step 2.
2. **Check if there are passengers on the current floor**: Yes. Go to step 3.
3. **Check if the elevator is moving down**: No. Go to step 4.
4. **Check if there are passengers waiting on a higher floor**: Yes. move to the next floor.

**Output**:  
```plaintext
Optimal action: move
```
