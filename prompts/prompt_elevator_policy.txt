Determine the optimal action for the elevator system in a given state, based on the provided conditions and constraints to efficiently transport passengers.

Consider the following critical factors:
- The elevator's current direction.
- Number of people on each floor waiting to be picked up.
- Number of people currently in the elevator and the elevator capacity.
- Whether the door is open or closed.
- The main goal: efficiently transport as many passengers as possible from floors 2 to 5 to the first floor.

The environment's goal is to move passengers from floors 2 to 5 to the first floor as quickly as possible.

Follow these details to make decisions:

- **Goal**: Maximize the number of passengers transported from floors 2-5 to the first floor.
- **Elevator Rules**:
  - Can only pick up passengers if the door is open.
  - Only moves between floors if the door is closed.
  - Can change direction only when at the top or bottom floor or when picking up passengers while moving up.
  - Picks up additional passengers while moving down if space is available.

# Steps

1. **Assess the Current State**:
   - Check if the elevator is moving up or down.
   - Determine if the door is open or closed.
   - Evaluate the number of passengers on each floor and the number in the elevator.

2. **Determine Valid Actions**:
   - Analyze the possible actions based on the state, such as moving, opening/closing the door, or waiting.
   
3. **Decide on Optimal Action**:
   - Base the decision on efficiency toward reaching the goal of ferrying passengers from upper floors to the first floor.
   - Consider maximizing elevator capacity usage while following the movement and direction rules.

# Output Format

Provide the optimal action in the following format, given the current state of the elevator:

```plaintext
Optimal action: [action]
```

Where the action is one of:
- `nothing`
- `move`
- `open door`
- `close door`

# Examples

**Example 1**  
**State**:  
People waiting at floor 2: 0  
People waiting at floor 3: 0  
People waiting at floor 4: 1  
People waiting at floor 5: 0  
Elevator at floor 2.  
There are 0 people in the elevator.  
Elevator is moving down.  
Elevator door is open.  

**Reasoning**:  
- The goal is to pick up passengers if possible to maximize efficiency.
- Since there is no one waiting on floor 2, the optimal action is to `close door` to proceed with movement.

**Output**:  
```plaintext
Optimal action: close door
```

**Example 2**  
**State**:  
People waiting at floor 2: 0  
People waiting at floor 3: 3  
People waiting at floor 4: 0  
People waiting at floor 5: 2  
Elevator at floor 5.  
There are 3 people in the elevator.  
Elevator is moving down.  
Elevator door is closed.  

**Reasoning**:  
- The elevator is at the top floor and moving down, and since the door is closed, the optimal action is to `open door` to pick up more passengers.

**Output**:  
```plaintext
Optimal action: open door
```  

**Example 3**  
**State**:  
People waiting at floor 2: 0  
People waiting at floor 3: 3 
People waiting at floor 4: 0  
People waiting at floor 5: 1  
Elevator at floor 3.  
There are 0 people in the elevator.  
Elevator is moving up.  
Elevator door is closed.  

**Reasoning**:  
- The elevator is at floor 3 and is moving up. There 3 people waiting at floor 3 and 1 people waiting at floor 5. The optimal strategy is to move up to pick up the passenger at floor 5 first and the pick up the passenger at floor 3 later on the way down.

**Output**:  
```plaintext
Optimal action: move
```  

# Notes

- Always prioritize picking up passengers on the higher floors if there is space in the elevator to improve round trip efficiency.
- Ensure that the elevator adheres to direction rules: it can only change direction at the top or bottom floor or when picking passengers up while moving up.
- Movement is prohibited if the door is open, focus on closing it before initiating movement.
- It is more advantageous for the elevator to be at the higher floors in general to be ready to pick up passengers.
- Strictly follow the format of the output of the example above.
